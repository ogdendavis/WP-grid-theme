This is a responsive HTML/CSS page created for a Thinkful challenge.

The premise of the challenge is to create a live demo from designs provided. The provided designs are in the design folder, and the provided images are in the images folder. The rest of the work is my own.

I extended this challenge by using two breakpoints instead of one, as described in the comments in grid.css. I'm not sure if this made it harder or easier, since each item basically became its own row, so I had to split up the row functionality I'd used in previous exercises, putting some (width, centering) into the container div for the whole grid and others (Clear-fixing) into the individual items.
