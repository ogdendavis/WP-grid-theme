This is a responsive HTML/CSS page created for a Thinkful challenge.

The premise of the challenge is to create a live demo from designs provided. The
provided designs are in the design folder, and the provided images are in the
images folder. The rest of the work is my own.

I initially extended this challenge by using two breakpoints instead of one, so
that the images would appear three-across in large screens (laptops, desktops),
two-across in mid-size screens (tablets, large phones in landscape), and one-
across in small screens (phones in portrait). I finished this version, but upon
re-reading the challenge requirements, realized that my modifications meant that
my project no longer fulfilled the specific requirements of the project.

The final version of this project fulfills the requirements of the challenge,
and adds one bonus feature. If you want to see the version with the two-across
intermediate float, refer to the commit titled "Style cards", viewable at this
